Originally known as 'NitroPackager' [I lost the unpackaged python file, so i cannot change the title at the topðŸ˜­]
PythonPackager can take any Python project and package it into an EXE file so your work can't be stolen!

# How to use
1. Select your file
2. Wait, this may take a few minutes.
3. Go to where the unpackaged file was located.
4. Your packaged file should be there.
